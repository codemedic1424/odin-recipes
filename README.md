This is a demonstration project for The Odin Project. The demonstration will show the basic HTML knowledge as covered in the courses and tutorials leading up to this project. 
-Post project reflections to follow-

This project was a wonderful personal test for me. I liked being able to recall boilerplate from memory. Further study is needed on file appending, staging, and commit. I am still unsure as to the terminal commands and when it is appropriate to run. I plan to review the previous courses and external sources.
